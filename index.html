        <h2>I Tested Every Colored Pencil to Find the BEST ONE!</h2>
        <p>
          This article is currently under construction while my team and I
          gather all the information we have collected and build it into a
          format that’s easy for you to read! We’ll be including the results of
          every pencil for every test over the next few weeks. For now, you can
          watch the video below to see the summary, and find all of the tested
          brands with links to purchase below. If you’d like to be notified by
          email when everything is updated, you can join my email newsletter,
          and you’ll also get a free coloring book.

        <h2>Ultimate White Pen Shopping Guide (White Pen Series: Part 2)</h2>
        <p>
          If you caught Part One of this series, you know that I’ve I spent
          countless hours testing and re-testing as many white pens as I can
          find to bring you the ultimate best white pen. I took 61 white gel
          pens, white paint pens and white inks and tested them on black paper,
          over pencils and markers and so much more, eliminating a few pens at
          each round until we reached what I believe were the final few, best
          quality pens. In this blog, I have put together the ultimate buying
          guide to white pens and markers so you can decide the best white pen
          for your art. This article is part two in our series on White Pens so
          be sure to check out Part 1 HERE and keep an eye out for part 3!
